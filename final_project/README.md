# Human Vs Machine
can you tell if you are over or underweight?

## About this project:
We often think that obesity cause by overeating, however that's not only the case. Nowadays, obesity has become a significant threat for all people from every age, worldwide. Unhealthy lifestyle, eating excessive junk food, late-night sleep, spend a long time sitting down are several factors that contribute to obesity.. Overweight and obesity refer to excess body weight, which is a risk factor for many diseases and chronic conditions and is associated with higher rates of death. It mainly occurs because of an imbalance between energy intake (from the diet) and energy expenditure (through physical activities and bodily functions)

"so, if I'm overweight do I mean i am also Obese? what is the difference between overweight and obese?"
Overweight is when the BMI greater than or equal to 25; and how we measure if we are obese is when the BMI (Body Mass Index) is greater than or equal to 30. If you are overweight, potentially you will become obese if precautions being ignored.

If the current trend continues, the overweight and obese population is likely to increase to 41% by 2030. Individuals developing signs of weight gain or obesity are also at a risk of developing serious illnesses such as type 2 diabetes, respiratory problems, heart disease and stroke. Some intervention measures such as physical activity and healthy eating can be a fundamental component to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Therefore, it is absolutely essential to detect obesity as early as possible.

## Approach
1. Identify data sources and dependencies
2. Collect and clean trajectory data
3. Applying Machine Learning algorithms (decision tree, Lasso, Random Forest Classifier, XGBClassifier)
4. Comparative Analysis
5. Create Flask App and connect routes to local host
6. Create charts and map using Tableau
7. Customise html for final application
8. Visualise dashboard locally
